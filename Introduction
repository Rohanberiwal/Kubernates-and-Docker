Contanier and the vms 

container are abstraction  , at the app layer that packages and the the dependences together  . Multiple container can run on the same machines and share the OS kernal with the other container , each running as the isloated processes in the user space . 

conatiner does not require full operating system , unlike the vm  .It shares the os with the underlying apps . 

Virutal machines 
These are the abstraction of the physical hardware turning one server into multiple servers . The hypervisor allows the Vm;s to run a single machine , Each Vm include a full copy of the operarign system  , the necessary and the binaries , taking a lot of space and hence a lot of time to boot .

Several benefits :
1> Run the container to save the time and the save .  
2> Uses the less memeroy
